# Insect Shooter Game - Development Log

## Overview
This document tracks all changes and improvements made to the Insect Shooter game during development.

## Game Features Implemented

### Core Gameplay
- **Player Movement**: Arrow key controls for horizontal movement
- **Shooting System**: Spacebar to fire projectiles upward
- **Enemy Types**: 5 different enemy types with unique behaviors
- **Wave System**: Unlimited continuous waves with progressive difficulty
- **Health System**: Player has 3 lives, enemies have varying health points
- **Scoring System**: Points awarded for destroying enemies

### Enemy Types
1. **Ant**: Basic enemy, moves straight down
2. **Spider**: Hangs from web thread, oscillates up and down
3. **Beetle**: Armored enemy with higher health
4. **Wasp**: Flies in zigzag pattern
5. **Queen**: Boss enemy that appears every 10 waves, shoots back at player

### Power-Up System
- **Gun Upgrades**: 5-tier weapon upgrade system
  - Tier 1: Single shot
  - Tier 2: Double shot
  - Tier 3: Triple shot
  - Tier 4: Quad shot
  - Tier 5: Penta shot
- **Health Power-Up**: Restores player health
- **Power-ups drop randomly when enemies are destroyed**

### Audio System
- **Shooting Sound**: Audio feedback when firing
- **Explosion Sound**: Audio when enemies are destroyed
- **Power-up Sound**: Audio when collecting power-ups

## Major Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Wave 6 Stuck Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: Game would get stuck at wave 6 and not progress to subsequent waves.

**Root Cause**: Enemies were spawning too close to the screen edge and being immediately removed.

**Solution**:
- Changed enemy spawn Y coordinate from `-20 - (i * 20)` to `-50 - (i * 30)`
- Applied same fix to safety spawn mechanism
- Enemies now spawn further off-screen, preventing immediate removal

### Spider Rendering Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: Spider enemies sometimes showed only the web thread without the spider body.

**Root Cause**: Spider's `webY` position could go above the anchor point, causing the body to be drawn off-screen.

**Solution**:
- Modified bounds checking from `this.webY < this.y` to `this.webY < this.y + 20`
- Added clamping mechanism: `this.webY = Math.max(this.y + 20, Math.min(this.webY, this.y + 100))`
- Spider body now always remains visible 20-100 pixels below its anchor point

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Debugging Cleanup**: Removed excessive console.log statements
- **Performance**: Optimized collision detection and rendering
- **Code Organization**: Improved structure and readability

## Technical Implementation Details

### Wave Progression System
- Enemies per wave: `Math.max(5, 3 + wave)`
- Progressive difficulty scaling with wave number
- Queen enemies spawn every 10 waves
- Safety mechanism ensures enemies spawn if none are generated

### Collision Detection
- Projectile-to-enemy collision detection
- Enemy-to-player collision detection
- Player-to-power-up collision detection
- Efficient rectangular collision detection algorithm

### Enemy Behavior Patterns
- **Ant**: Linear downward movement
- **Spider**: Slow descent with oscillating web position
- **Beetle**: Standard movement with higher durability
- **Wasp**: Sinusoidal flight pattern
- **Queen**: Slow movement with counter-attack capability

### Visual Effects
- **Health Bars**: Display for damaged enemies
- **Particle Effects**: Explosion effects when enemies are destroyed
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for each enemy type
- **Damage Indication**: Visual feedback when enemies take damage

## Game Balance
- **Enemy Health**: Balanced across different types
- **Weapon Progression**: Gradual power increase through upgrades
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Appropriate challenge progression
- **Power-up Frequency**: Balanced drop rates for sustainable gameplay

## Files Modified
- `index.html`: Main game file containing all game logic, rendering, and audio
- `PRD.md`: Product requirements document (existing)
- `TRAE.md`: This development log (new)

## Current Status
